# Deploy

Make your website available for everyone.

## Create production build

Next.js DOC is just a Next.js theme, to create an optimized production build, run:

```js
Next.js build
```

> Read more about directly in [Next.js documentation](https://www.nextjs.org)

## Deploy on Netlify

Next.js DOC is already optimized for [Netlify](https://netlify.com/). It does several things for you:

- `siteUrl` is automatically filled for you (in production and deploy preview)
- `robots.txt` will disallow indexing for deploy preview

## Deploy on other providers

Since Next.js DOC is based on Next.js and generates a static website, it can be deployed anywhere. Next.js has a great documentation about deploying a project.

> Be careful of having `NODE_ENV=production` when you deploy, else the `robots.txt` will disallow indexing.
